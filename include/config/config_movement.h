// Changes Mario's ground turn radius by making it dependent on the analog stick magnitude and speed.
// #define VELOCITY_BASED_TURN_SPEED

// Allows Mario to easily side flip when moving forwards at any speed.
// #define SIDE_FLIP_AT_LOW_SPEEDS

// Allows Mario to aim towards a new direction at the end of turning around,
// and allows Mario to turn around multiple times in a row.
// #define RESET_DIRECTION_WHEN_TURNING_AROUND

// Improved hanging:
// - Doesn't require holding down the A button.
// - Precise turning control.
// - Prevents falling from the edges.
#define BETTER_HANGING

// Change the movement speed when hanging from a ceiling (the vanilla value is 4.0f, has no effect if BETTER_HANGING is enabled).
#define HANGING_SPEED 12.0f

// Prevents Mario from falling asleep while idle.
// #define NO_SLEEP

// Disables fall damage.
#define NO_FALL_DAMAGE

// Disables the scream that mario makes when falling off a great height (this is separate from actual fall damage).
// #define NO_FALL_DAMAGE_SOUND

// Fall height for normal fall damage. Vanilla is 1150.
#define FALL_DAMAGE_HEIGHT_SMALL 1150

// Fall height for double fall damage. Vanilla is 3000.
#define FALL_DAMAGE_HEIGHT_LARGE 3000

// Disables Mario getting stuck in snow and sand when falling.
// #define NO_GETTING_BURIED

// Prevents hands-free holding.
#define HANDS_FREE_HOLDING_FIX

// Prevents Mario from losing his cap.
// #define PREVENT_CAP_LOSS

// Enables Platform Displacement 2, also known as momentum patch. Makes Mario keep the momemtum from moving platforms.
#define PLATFORM_DISPLACEMENT_2

// Uses Shindou's pole behavior.
#define SHINDOU_POLES (0 | VERSION_SH)

// If A and Z are pressed on the same frame while running, Mario will long jump instead of ground pound.
#define EASIER_LONG_JUMPS

// Enable being able to immediately long jump after landing from a long jump.
#define IMMEDIATE_LONG_JUMPS

// Prevents long jumps getting canceled by steep floors by increasing Mario's initial vertical velocity when long jumping uphill.
#define PITCHED_LONG_JUMPS

// Enables the ability to hold Z while twirling to descend faster.
#define Z_TWIRL

// Enables the ability to dive during the ground pound spin animation, similar to Super Mario Odyssey.
// #define GROUND_POUND_DIVE

// Makes GROUND_POUND_DIVE change Mario's yaw to the exact direction of the analog stick.
// Has no effect if GROUND_POUND_DIVE is disabled.
// #define GROUND_POUND_DIVE_CHANGES_DIRECTION

// Disables bonks when ground pounding next to a wall.
#define DISABLE_GROUNDPOUND_BONK

// Allows Mario to jump kick on steep surfaces that are set to be non slippery, instead of being forced to dive.
#define JUMP_KICK_FIX

// Allows Mario to transition into a punch/dive/jump kick action when landing.
#define ATTACK_FROM_LANDING

// Allows Mario to grab hangable ceilings from any state.
#define HANGING_FIX

// The last frame after hitting a wall that will be considered a firsty when wallkicking.
#define FIRSTY_LAST_FRAME 1

// The maximum angle the player can wall kick, in degrees. 0..90. To allow 45 degree wall kicks, you must supply `46` to allow 45 and under.
#define WALL_KICK_DEGREES 45

// This is vanilla behavior, disable it to allow ledge grabbing regardless of floor pitch.
#define LEDGE_GRABS_CHECK_SLOPE_ANGLE

// Enables bonking and wall kicking at the top of walls. This fixes some janky vanilla behavior caused by ledge grab mechanics, but may cause bonking in places where you would expect to ledge grab.
// #define WALL_KICK_TOP_OF_WALLS

// Disables BLJs and crushes SimpleFlips's dreams.
// #define DISABLE_BLJ

// Re-enables upwarping when entering water. Forces you to only enter water from the top.
// #define WATER_PLUNGE_UPWARP

// When Mario hits a floor underwater, his pitch approaches the floor pitch instead of instantly snapping to it.
#define SMOOTH_PITCH_WHEN_HITTING_FLOOR_UNDERWATER

// Number of subframe steps (quarter steps).
#define NUM_STEPS_GROUND 16 // Vanilla is 4. 16 is recommended.
#define NUM_STEPS_AIR    16 // Vanilla is 4. 16 is recommended.
#define NUM_STEPS_WATER   4 // Vanilla is 1.  4 is recommended.

// Increases/decreases the number of subframe steps (quarter steps) depending on Mario's speed.
// Not needed if the above values are high enough.
// #define VARIABLE_NUM_STEPS

// Sends a raycast between Mario's current and next position so that walls don't get skipped.
// This also removes subframe steps (quarter steps).
// #define RAYCAST_WALL_COLLISION
